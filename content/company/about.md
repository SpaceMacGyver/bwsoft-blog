## What is a bellwether?
Among sheep, one is sent ahead to serve as a leader - the bellwether. This position is not one of authority or esteem,
but of service by example. At the front of the herd, the bellwether provides guidance by being the first to tread the
path.

## How does Bellwether Softworks live up to its name?
Software development is a constantly changing landscape of opportunity, but is also rife with challenge and many ways to
approach problems. Bellwether Softworks strives to lead customers to the solutions that best fit them, with an emphasis
on understanding and meeting their business needs.

## Who is Bellwether?

Helmed by veteran software developer Justin Bell, and occasionally augmented with work study positions to foster future
talent, Bellwether Softworks is an Iowa-based consultancy that aims to solve the myriad needs of regional SMBs, with a
focus on process automation and increasing efficiency among existing workflows.  Examples of some of the types of projects
that we have addressed include:

* Back-office automation (data processing, ETL, reporting)
* Front-facing media (web content, customer kiosks)
* Hardware automation (linear motion, laser marking, CNC)
* Geometric model processing (BIM analysis and processing)

We employ the appropriate technology to satisfy any customer's particular needs, and have a particular love for the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and its growing ecosystem for safe and performant software.
Some of the other stacks we've developed software for have included C#, TypeScript, PowerShell, and Python; and we
gladly embrace whatever best suits the immediate goals of a given project.
